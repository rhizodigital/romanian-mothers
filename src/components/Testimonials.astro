      "Having known the work of Romanian Mothers in the UK from its very start almost 10 years ago, I was impressed with how well the community was coordinated, with clear rules around respect and inclusion. The groups set a very high standard for a new and emerging community that needed help navigating systems and connecting with others to combat isolation and foster a feeling of belonging. I congratulate the team for registering their initiative as a charitable organisation and I envisage a bright future for them and those they support",

      "Partnership and collaboration are the backbone of a successful relationship between NGO’s for the benefit of the community. Roconect’s collaboration with Romanian Mothers in UK has already proven itself effective and highly impactful for the beneficiaries of our services. We have been working together on many projects. Some projects provided humanitarian relief for those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in the Ukraine, other project have been more targeted to specific segments of the community.",
      "Romanian Mothers in UK and especially Mrs Irina Stanean have rolled up their sleeves to support us online and in person. It was a season of steep growth and development for both our organisations. But we had fun learning the ever changing processes and procedures and what is more important, people in need were valued, helped and given new hope.",
      "We have always said the the power of online mothers groups should never be underestimated.  They are a powerful force, who have sharp eyes to see the need, can gather and mobilise to offer solutions with kindness and warmth that only a mother’s heart is able of.",
      "We are very appreciative of all their hard work and commitment to better those around them.",
